        {
          "question": "What do I need to get started with website development?",
          "answer": "You contact us and briefly describe the type of website You need: its purpose, design preferences, and desired functionality. Based on this information, we conduct a preliminary analysis and within 1–5 business days provide You with an estimate: implementation options, approximate cost, and timelines. Once the main conditions are agreed upon, we move to the next stage — a detailed analysis, clarifying Your needs, and preparing the technical specifications. We handle all technical planning and technology selection. All we need from You is the desire to bring Your idea to life and a bit of time for an initial discussion."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you use templates or website builders, or do you develop websites from scratch?",
          "answer": "Every website we create is built from scratch — tailored specifically to Your needs. This gives full freedom in implementation: we can bring any ideas You have to life, without the limitations of templates or builders. We use modern technologies that allow us to build fast, secure, and flexible websites. This approach makes it easy to expand the project in the future — adding new pages, features, or integrating third-party services. We follow proven development practices to ensure that Your site runs smoothly, looks great, and stays user-friendly for all visitors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will I be able to edit text and other content on the site myself?",
          "answer": "Yes, we build websites that allow You to edit text, images, products, and other content through an easy-to-use admin panel. We predefine which sections will be editable — so managing the site is simple, convenient, and risk-free. After the launch, we provide clear instructions (text or video format), and if needed — a short training session, so You feel confident using all features. In the future, the admin panel’s functionality can be expanded upon request."
        },
        {
          "question": "What technologies do you use and why?",
          "answer": "We use modern, widely adopted technologies — JavaScript frameworks and tools such as React, Next.js, Node.js, and React Native. These are used by leading companies around the world, which means they are actively developed, well-supported, and will stay relevant for many years. By choosing these technologies, we ensure that Your website or app is not only fast and reliable today but also ready for future growth. New sections, features, or even mobile apps can be added later — without having to rebuild everything from scratch. Another benefit is that if You decide to work with another developer later on, they’ll easily be able to continue working on the project — because these technologies are so common. So You’re not only getting a high-quality result, but peace of mind that Your project will stay up-to-date and won’t become obsolete."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you help with domain selection, hosting setup, and adding the site to Google?",
          "answer": "Yes, we handle all of these technical steps for You. We’ll help choose a good domain name, set up hosting, connect email, register the site with Google Search Console, and integrate Google Analytics to track visits. We take care of all service registrations, and once the project is complete, we transfer all access details to You (keys, passwords, logins) and explain how to change them for maximum security. You’ll have full control over Your website and all connected services."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is the price of the website determined, and can I know it in advance?",
          "answer": "The cost depends on the scope of work — design, number of pages, complexity of the features, and third-party integrations. It also matters whether You already have a design or if it needs to be created from scratch. After a short briefing, we analyze Your requirements and within 1–5 days provide a detailed estimate — including the approximate cost, timeframe, and implementation options. For example: a simple multi-page website without complex features and with an existing design may cost from $100. A full-featured, multi-page site with integrations and a custom backend can start from $1,000. But each project is unique — for instance, You may already have a server and only need the frontend redesigned. That’s why the final price is always determined individually after clarifying all the details."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I start with a small website now and expand it later?",
          "answer": "Yes, absolutely. We use modern technologies that allow Your site to grow over time — adding new pages, features, or even connecting mobile or web apps. This makes it easy to evolve the project without needing a complete rebuild. Your website can later become part of a larger ecosystem — for example, a site and app working together as one system."
